Steps to achieve the project goal

1. Set up uv environment in your project directory
   a. First check if uv setup is there "uv --version"
   b. If set up not there, run "powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" in powershell
   c. In environment variable set up the path
   d. Once setup is done, run "uv init ." in your terminal. Your uv environment will be set up.

2. Create a virtual environment with the help of uv
   a. Run in terminal "uv venv .venv"  (dont do this)
   b. Create a requirements.txt file, write the command "python-dotenv"
   c. Run in terminal "uv add -r requirements.txt"
3. Run in terminal "uv add ipykernel"   
4. Run in terminal "uv sync"  (Add synchronization between dependencies in files and folders)
5. Create the required folders for our project
   a. data (Here, we will store the data incoming from user, also will store processed data here)
   b. multi_doc_chat (This is where we will write the actual modular structure code)
      It includes - 1. config 2. exception  3. logger 4. model 5. prompts 6. src 7. utils
6. Create a notebook folder for running experiments.
7. Create a static folder -> style.css (Here, we will have the css files)
8. Create a templates folder -> html files (Here, we will have html files for the frontend part)
9. Create a test folder, here we will do the testing part like unit test, integration test
