Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that go beyond passive response and act with 
autonomy, reasoning, and tool use. Unlike traditional models that only generate outputs when 
prompted, agentic systems can plan tasks, select strategies, and orchestrate actions toward a goal.
 They operate in a loop of perception, planning, and execution: first interpreting the context, 
 then breaking down the problem into steps, and finally choosing the right tools or APIs to 
 complete each step.

For example, when asked to summarize a research paper, an agentic AI doesn’t just produce text. It 
may load the document, parse its structure, extract key sections, and then apply a language model 
to generate a concise summary. If the input is an image, it might call an OCR service to extract
text before reasoning about the content. This ability to combine multiple capabilities dynamically
makes agentic AI more powerful and flexible than static models.

The defining traits of agentic AI are:

Autonomy: It can initiate actions beyond a single prompt.

Reasoning: It decomposes complex tasks into manageable steps.

Tool use: It integrates external services (databases, APIs, search engines) to achieve goals.

Adaptability: It monitors outcomes and adjusts its approach when conditions change.

In practice, agentic AI is the foundation of modern GenAI applications — 
from chatbots that can book tickets or translate documents, to research assistants that can 
retrieve data, analyze it, and present insights. It represents a shift from “AI as a 
passive model” to “AI as an active collaborator,” capable of decision-making, execution, and 
continuous improvement.
